PATTERNS:
Throughout the development of the game, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was employed to structure the game into classes like Card, Deck, Tableau, and Game. This approach made the code modular, easier to maintain, and scalable for additional features or changes. The Observer Pattern was utilized to ensure that changes in the game state, such as when cards are moved or shuffled, are automatically reflected throughout the game. Additionally, the Command Pattern was applied to handle actions like moving a card or drawing from the stock, making it easier to track and manage player actions.

POSTMORTEM:
Looking back, there were several aspects of the project that went well. The modular design helped in managing the game objects like cards and piles, making the game more organized and easier to understand. The drag-and-drop mechanics for moving cards were intuitive, and they worked responsively, providing a smooth user experience. Game state management was also effective, as the stock, tableau, and foundation piles updated properly in response to player actions.

We have all the neccissary mechanics, as well as an included timer and step counter, though I had tried to implement an undo button, which failed due to time constraints.
